I made this fork of the main Ushahidi instance because I was encountering problems running it after installation due to a conflict with the PHP installation on my web server.

It's not a problem everyone will encounter, but if you're getting "Fatal error: Call to undefined method Locale::get_i18n()" after completing the install, this might help.

If you'd prefer to do it manually, or are having trouble, here's my step by step: 

1. Rename the file application/helpers/locale.php to locate.php
2. In application/helpers/locate.php, change line 10 to: 
class locate_Core
3. In application/helpers/locate.php, change line 507 to:   	
$directories[$i18n_dir] = locate::language($locale[0])." (".$locale[1].")";
4. In application/libraries/themes.php, change line 214 to:
$locales = locate::get_i18n();
5. In application/controllers/admin/settings.php, change line 362 to:
$locales = locate::get_i18n();
6. In application/controllers/admin/manage.php, change line 56 to:	
$locales = locate::get_i18n();
